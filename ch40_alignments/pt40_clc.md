The emergence of cellular life depended on the existence of biological membranes. Concurrent with this, the evolution of complicated membrane-embedded proteins remains to be understood. In this analysis, we focus on the evolutionary path of Chloride channels/transporters (ClC for “Chloride carriers”); appreciating the structural symmetry underlying the complex structure of modern examples and the possible requirements for evolution of a well characterized fold.

For known dimeric dual-topology proteins (such as EmrE), evidence in the genomic record demonstrates examples of evolutionary paths towards fix-topology and fused inverted repeats. Here, we look for evidence of homologs that are half-inverted repeats for proteins with clear internal structural symmetry.  Structurally, it has been known for many years that the ClC protein family forms dimers where the functional unit is monomer that contains internal symmetry; however, the two half-repeats appear to be structurally dependent. Recently, Bowie and colleagues demonstrated that each of the half-repeats fold independently suggesting that they may have evolved separately. Based on this observation, we ask if evolutionary intermediates of ClC half-repeats persist in other genomes such as either dual- or fixed-topology pairs.
