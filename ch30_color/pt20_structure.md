Structural biologists, let’s mind our colors
============================================

Most representations of macromolecules are aimed at those well-versed in structural biology and require prior familiarity with commonly used color schemes. However, as structures are determined faster and scientists from a wider range of biomedical subjects start to use structural data, making these representations accessible to all is paramount. To achieve this, structural biologists must use perceptually uniform colormaps, consider readers with different modes of color vision, and be explicit about scales and color usage. Here we explain how to create structural biology figures that are truer to the hard-won data and more accessible to readers, and we provide software plugins to help in this endeavor.
